# Suicide-prediction-using-Machine-learning-algorithm.
The aim here was to build a predictive machine learning supervised model and also try to determine which factors have a significant impact on the number of suicide that occur every year.

# Libraries required
* seaborn 
* numpy 
* matplotlib
* pandas  
* sklearn

# About the model's created and conclusion:
The suicide dataset was fit into 3 different supervised classifiers. Compared to all the three classification algorithms Random forest gives the best accuracy. But after introducing an ensemble method called has Adaboost, Decision tree performed well with least test errors. The results of this research demonstrate that the Random forest is a superior algorithm as the evaluation metrics such as mean squared error, mean absolute error and root mean squared error where all better for the random forest algorithm. Also Decision tree performs well boosting technique with more computation period.Everything is implemented in the Jupyter notebook which will hopefully make it easier to understand the code.

# This reprository contains:
 * 2 jupyter notebooks which have eda and ML models implimented.
 * documentation pdf file.
 * app.py which is the program which will be deployed on heroku.
 * The remaing files such as setup.sh, requirements.txt, Procfile are used when deploying the model on heroku.
